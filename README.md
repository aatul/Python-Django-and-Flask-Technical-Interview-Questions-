### 1. What do you like about Python and what you dislike about it?

**Likes:**
- Ease of interaction with other languages and platforms with 3rd party modules available in Python Package Index (PyPI). Also extensive support of libraries reduces the code writing effort significantly.
- Built in data structures and dynamic high level data typing allows faster implementation with less LoCs.
- Ease of learning and code redability because of its indentation oriented syntax.

**Dislikes:** 
- Speed- being an interpreted language, it is not best suited for time-critical tasks. 
- Multithreading - due to the Global Interpreter Lock.
